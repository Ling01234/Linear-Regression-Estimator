\section{Introduction}

% The housing market represents a complex interplay of various factors that
% contribute to the determination of property prices. In this study, we
% investigate into a comprehensive housing dataset, which captures a numerous of
% covariates influencing house prices. The dataset encompasses essential features
% such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, floor count, and
% location details, among others.
Linear regression is a tool used in a wide array of statistical applications.
In Python, there are many different packages providing implementations for the
regression technique, and they may be overwhelming for some mathematicians
coming from R into Python. In this project, we design a linear regression
package bridging the gap between R and Python. Our package provides the basic
functionalities of fitting a linear model and providing summaries in more or
less the same way as done in R. In the following sections, you will learn how
to use the package, including the different functionalities provided, as well
as an example application on an existing dataset.

\newpage
\section{Functionality}
The package offers the following primary functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fit(X: NumPy array, y: NumPy array): internally computes and stores the linear
          regression weights for a model fitted on X and y (including the intercept)
    \item predict(X: NumPy array): internally stores the target predictions and residuals
          for the provided X data
    \item plotting functions: different functions to plot the regression lines and their
          confidence intervals
    \item metrics functions: functions that internally store various metrics of the model
          (update\_metrics updates all of them automatically)
    \item summarize(): generates a summary of the model, much like in R
\end{itemize}
By default, the plots and metrics that are computed by the model are stored in the figure folder. Internally, the package uses NumPy matrix functions to compute the weights.
The package assumes the intercept is not included in the covariates ands temporarily adds a column of ones to X in order to include the intercept in the weight computations.

\newpage
\section{Usage}
In order to use the model, the covariate matrix and the target vector must be
converted to NumPy arrays. If .csv files are being used for the datasets, it is
recommended to first import the data into a Pandas dataframe using the
read\_csv function. Afterwards, the covariates and targets may be extracted and
converted to NumPy arrays using the to\_numpy function. The main.py file
provides an example application of these steps.

\newpage
\section{Toy Dataset Overview}
The dataset contains the following covariates: [id, date, price, bedrooms,
bathrooms, sqft living, sqft lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade,
sqft above, sqft basement, yr built, yr renovated, zipcode, lat, long, sqft
living15, and sqft lot15]. While each of these variables holds potential
insights, certain attributes are deemed irrelevant for our analysis.
Specifically, the variables id, data, waterfront, view, condition, zipcode,
lat, long are excluded from our study. Additionally, to focus our analysis on a
more representative range of house prices, we have excluded houses with prices
exceeding \$2 million.

\newpage
\section{Objective of the Analysis}
Our primary objective is to understand the intricate relationship between the
selected covariates and the housing prices. To achieve this, we employ three
distinct Linear Regression models. The models include a univariate model, which
explores the impact of \verb|sqft_living| on house prices; a bivariate model,
which explores the impact of \verb|sqft_living, yr_built| on prices; and a
multivariate model, which explores the effect of all interested covariates on
prices.

\newpage
\section{Model Visualizations}

\subsection{Univariate Model}

In the univariate case, we measure the relationship between the size of the
living room versus the price of the house. Below show the the result of our
model. In this plot, we've also added a confidence interval of 95\%.

    \caption{Univariate Linear Regression}
    \label{fig: univariate}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bivariate Model}
In the bivariate case, we measure the relationship between the size of the
living room and the built year versus the price of the house. Below we show the
relationship of the covariates with the housing price via a 3D plot.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the project offers a basic implementation of linear regression
similar to the way it is presented in R. An example application on the toy
dataset shows how to use the package on a dataset from a .csv file, which is
the kind of data one works with in a lot of cases. One of the challenges in the
project was keeping everything in order and organized, since many of the
functions are interdependent (one erroneous function would make everything
erroneous). In the future, it would be worth exploring and implementing
additional kinds of regression into the model, and incorporating finer machine
learning techniques.
