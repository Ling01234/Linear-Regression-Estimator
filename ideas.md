# Linear Regression Estimator Package

## Module and classes

1. Least squares estimations: $\hat{\beta}$ for intercepts and slopes
2. Hypothesis testing
3. Confidence intervals
5. Residual analysis: plotting residuals, detecting potential outliers, etc.
6. Model summary: create a summary function that gives an overview of the regression result, like in R. R squared values, to determine the quality of the estimator
7. Visualization functions for regression line, predicted values, data points, etc.
8. Make sure to document the code

## Analysis

1. Include example datasets for testing and analysis
2. We can have simple linear regression and multiple linear regressions
3. Compare to Python's implementation (sklearn) the accuracy of our implementation

# TODO:
1. run models
2. write report
